## Deployment to Web Server (Cyclic)

Cyclic pre-provision AWS serverless infrastructure to make every deployment, even the first, super fast. This means Cyclic are able to deploy in seconds. Usually about 6 seconds for apps with a few dependencies. It can take longer if your app has a long build step (nextjs for example). Code is deployed as soon as it's GitHub repository has been connected to Cyclic. Cyclic will use the GitHub default branch to pull the repo contents. On GitHub the default branch is usually main or master. Every git push or change to the default branch will trigger a Cyclic deployment. This includes direct pushes as well as pull request merges.
